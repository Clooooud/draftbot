# Discord Tourney Draft Bot

I quickly made a simple Tourney Draft Bot that can be used to draft teams for a tournament.

You can use it for Snake Drafts (reversing the order each round, I did not implement the regular resetting order, it's quite simple to do tho, I might do it)

The bot is purely manual, for each team pick you need to type the `/draft next` command

## Usage

1. Create a Discord Bot and get the token
2. Invite the bot to your server
3. Rename the `example.env` file to `.env` and fill in the token
4. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the bot with `python main.py`
6. `/draft` !!!
